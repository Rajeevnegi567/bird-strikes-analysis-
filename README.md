## Overview
This repository contains a data analysis project focused on bird strikes in aviation. Bird strikes, defined as collisions between birds and aircraft, pose significant safety risks and financial implications for airlines and airports. The project aims to analyze bird strike data collected by the FAA between 2000 and 2011 to identify trends, assess risk factors, and propose mitigation strategies.

## Project Details
- **Data Source:** FAA bird strike data collected between 2000 and 2011.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Data cleaning was performed using Excel to remove irrelevant columns, handle missing values, and ensure data quality.
- **Insights:** The analysis includes insights such as trend analysis, top airlines and airports by bird strike incidents, yearly cost analysis, phase of flight analysis, altitude distribution, and impact of bird strikes on flight operations.
- **Dashboard Design:** A dynamic Power BI dashboard has been created to visualize the insights and allow for interactive exploration of the data. The dashboard includes interactive visuals, slicers for filtering data, and key performance indicators (KPIs) for quick insights.

## Dynamic Dashboard Usage
- Open the provided Power BI file.
- Navigate through the different sheets to explore the insights.
- Utilize slicers to filter data by year, airline, airport, and other relevant factors.
- Refer to KPIs for quick reference on important metrics.
